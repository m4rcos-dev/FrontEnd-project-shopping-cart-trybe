<a href='https://trybe-shopping-cart.netlify.app/'><button>Project running</button></a>

<p>Project developed during the front-end module of the Trybe full-stack web development course.</p>
<p>A fully dynamic shopping cart has been developed! :shopping_cart:</p>
<p>Data was consumed directly from an API! :star_struck:</p>
<p>An API is a point of contact on the internet with a certain service and in this project the Mercado Livre API was used to search for products for sale. :label:</p>
<p>In this project, test-oriented development, the famous TDD, was put into practice, which helps to ensure quality code, understanding the use cases of your application and ensuring that it is working correctly! :rocket:</p>
